<H2 class="pgh">TOPIC TWO: COMPUTER NETWORKING</H2>
<p class="pgh">A Computer network is a connection of two or more computers via communication devices in order to share data and<br> resources (printer, software, hard disk etc.). Computers on a network are called nodes or hosts.<br>
Types of computer network<br><br>
Local area network (LAN): This is a kind of network that involves connecting computers and other devices within<br> a limited geographical local such as a building, school, or home. A Wireless LAN (WLAN) is similar to a LAN <br>but uses wireless medium for connection.<br><br>
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): This network generally expands throughout a city such as cable TV. MAN can help<br> an organization to connect all of its offices in a city.<br><br>
Wide Area Network (WAN): This network covers a wide geographical area such as a country or even the world. Most<br> WANs consist of two or more LANs that are connected by routers. Communication channels can include telephone<br> systems, fiber optics, satellites, microwave etc. The largest WAN is the internet.<br>
Other variations include Personal Area Network (PAN), Campus Area Network (CAN), Home Area Network (HAN) etc.<br>
Network architecture<br>
Peer-to-peer: In this network, the computers connected together are called peers and each handles its security.<br> Peer-to-peer networks are designed to satisfy the networking needs of home networks or of small companies<br> that do not want to spend a lot of money on a dedicated server but still want to have the capability to share<br> information or devices.<br><br>
Client/Server: Computers (clients) are connected to a server. The server takes responsibility of storing <br>clients’ data and managing other computers (clients) in the network.<br> <br>
Network topology<br>
Topology is the arrangement of nodes (computers) and other devices within a network. Topology can either be:<br>
Physical topology: this is the actual layout of the computers and other connected devices.<br>
Logical topology: this describes the logical pathway signal flow as it passes among the network nodes. It <br>defines the way data passes among the nodes.<br><br>
Types of topology<br>
Bus topology: A bus topology uses one cable as a main trunk (or backbone) to connect all of the systems <br>together. Both ends of the shared channel have line terminator. The data is sent in only one direction and as<br> soon as it reaches the extreme end, the terminator removes the data from the line.<br>
 <br>
Star topology: In star topology, all computers are connected to a centralized device called a hub or a switch. <br>All data that is transferred from one computer to the other must pass through the hub/switch.<br>
 
Ring topology: In ring topology, each host machine connects to exactly two other machines, creating a circular<br> network structure. When one host tries to communicate or send message to a host which is not adjacent to it, <br>the data travels through all intermediate hosts.<br>
 
Mesh topology: In this type of topology, a host is connected to one or multiple hosts. This topology has hosts <br>in point-to-point connection with every other host or may also have hosts which are in point-to-point <br>connection with few hosts only.<br>
 
The other variation is the tree which a hybrid topology.<br>
Transmission medium<br>
•	Wired medium (guided medium) : physical cables (coaxial, twisted pairs, fiber optic cables)<br>
•	Wireless medium (unguided medium): infrared (IrDA), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Li-Fi, Satellite, Microwave<br>
Twisted pair (TP) cables <br>
Characteristics<br>
•	A twisted pair cable consists of two insulating copper wires arranged in a regular spiral pattern.<br>
•	A number of these pairs are bundled together into a cable by wrapping them into a tough protective sheath.<br>
•	Twisting decreases crosstalk interference between adjacent pairs in the cable<br>
•	Susceptible to interference and noise because of its easy coupling with electromagnetic fields.<br>
•	The standard connector is RJ45 (Register Jack 45)<br>
•	Most common in the telephone network<br>
•	Can either be Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) and Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)<br>
Coaxial cable<br>
Characteristics<br>
•	It consist of hollow outer cylindrical conductor that surround only a single inner wire conductor<br>
•	A single coaxial cable has a diameter of from 1 to 2.5cm <br>
•	Can be used over long distances<br>
•	Less susceptible to interference and crosstalk than TP.<br>
•	More expensive than twisted pair cable<br>
•	Connectors include BNC, BNC-T<br>
•	Used in Television distribution – cable TV, long distance telephone lines –NITEL wire, LAN – bus topology<br>
Fiber optics<br>
Characteristics 
•	Made up of glass or plastic and transmit signals in form of light.<br>
•	Glass or plastic core is surrounded by a cladding of less dense glass or plastic<br>
•	Can be single mode or multi-mode<br>
•	Outer jacket is made of Teflon or Polyvinylchloride (PVC)<br>
•	Best in terms of performance – can span longer distance and very low attenuation<br>
•	Immune to electromagnetic interference (it’s not made of copper wire)<br>
•	Connectors include Subscriber channel (SC) connector, Straight –tip (ST) connector, MT-RJ connector<br>
•	They are used in long distance telecommunication link, found in backbone network and LAN.<br>
Wireless Media<br>
•	Infrared (IrDA): This type of transmission is used for communication over short distances between sender and<br> receiver that are within the line of sight.<br>
•	Bluetooth: Bluetooth technology uses radio waves to connect mobile devices such as phones, PDAs, computer <br>etc. It has a limited transmission range of 10 meters.<br>
•	Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity): This is a technology that uses radio waves to provide high speed wireless <br>connection between electronic devices based on the IEEE 802.11x standards. <br>
•	Li-Fi (Light-Fidelity): LI-Fi is a form of visible light communication system that uses common household LED<br> (light emitting diode) light bulbs to enable data transfer, boasting speeds of up to 224 gigabits per second.<br>
•	Microwave: microwave signals are sent through space in the form of electromagnetic waves. Just like radio <br>signals, they also must be sent in straight lines from one microwave station to another. To avoid interference,<br> most microwave stations are built on mountain tops or placed on top of buildings.<br>
•	Satellite: communication satellites are placed in orbit 22300 feet above the earth surface. This allows the <br>satellite to maintain a constant position above one point on the earth surface by rotating at the same speed<br> as the earth.<br>
Networking devices<br>
•	Modem (modulator-demodulator) – allows computer to transmit data over analog telephone lines.<br>
•	Network Interface Card (NIC) – enables and controls the sending and receiving of data between the computers<br> in a network.<br>
•	Gateway: A software or hardware that link two different types of network that use different protocols.<br>
•	Router: A router connects multiple networks and determines the fastest available path to send packets of<br> data to their destination.<br>
•	Wireless Access Point (WAP)- a device that connects wireless communication devices together to create a <br>wireless network.<br>
•	Switch – an intelligent layer 2 networking device, that forwards data based on MAC (Media Access Control)<br> address. Forward directly to the destination. One broadcast domain, multiple collision domain<br>
•	Hub – a layer one device used to connect many computers within a network.  One broadcast domain, one <br>collision domain.<br>
•	Repeater – repeats signals that are tending towards attenuation.<br>
•	Bridges  <br>
Benefits of networking<br>
•	Information sharing- authorized users can access the computers on the network to share information and data.<br> May include special database, blogs, fax, FTP, internet telephony, IM, chat rooms<br>
•	Hardware sharing – printer or scanner can be shared on a network.<br>
•	Software sharing – software can be installed on a server, all users can access the program on the central <br>location.<br><br>
•	Collaborative environment – shared environment enables users to work together on group projects using <br>capabilities of diverse equipment and software <br>
Disadvantages<br>
•	Vulnerability to unauthorized access- hackers can access and steal or delete data<br>
•	Malicious code  - networked computers are more vulnerable to virus, worms, spyware than stand-alone computer<br> 
•	Network fault- problems to networking equipment can result in loss of data<br>
•	Setup and management cost - setting up a network requires investing in hardware and software and maintenance <br>of the network requires the care and attention of IT professional. <br>
