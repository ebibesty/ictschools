<p>A database is an organized collection of related data kept in a format that makes it easy to retrieve, access, modify, process and store. An example of simple database is an address book or a list containing students’ results.</p><br>
<p>A database package, also known as Database Management System (DBMS) is the term used to describe any computer software that is designed for creating databases and managing the information stored in them i.e. it manipulates, retrieves, and manages data in a database as well as interacts with the users and other applications. DBMS allows users create, query, update and administer databases. It also helps to maintain the integrity and security of stored data.</p>
<p><h3>Examples of DBMS</h3>
1.	DBase III<br>
2.	DBase IV<br>
3.	Foxbase<br>
4.	Oracle<br>
5.	Ingress<br>
6.	Paradox<br>
7.	MySql<br>
8.	Microsoft Access<br>
9.	PostgreSql<br>
10.	Microsoft SQL Server<br></p>
<h2>Element of a database</h2><br>
<b>The following are the elements of a database:</b><br>
<b>1.</b>	Table: A table stores records about a particular entity, and each record contains data about instances<br> of the table subject.<br>
<b>2.	</b>Records: this is the complete set of information concerning a specific item. It is a row of data in a<br>table<br>
<b>3.	</b>Field: this is individual column or piece of information about a record.<br>
<b>4.</b>	Key: A key field contains unique data used to identify each record so that it can be easily retrieved<br> and processed. A key field, for this context, is the primary key. Another type of key is the foreign key<br> which is the primary key of a table that is also a field in another table. This forms the basis of table<br>relationship. The AuthorID is primary to the Author’s table, while it is foreign to the book table, as shown<br> below.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<b>Forms of database<br>
Flat File Database</b> <br>
A flat file database is a type of database that stores data in a single table. Example of this database is a <br>telephone directory book that shows the list of telephone subscribers.<br>

Relational databases<br>
In a relational database, data is stored across multiple tables. The tables are related to each other through<br>foreign keys. In database terminology, tables are called "relations", rows are called "entities" and columns<br>are called "attributes”. Consider the diagram below, a teacher is related to the class through the teacherID<br>attribute. <br>
<br>






Hierarchical databases<br>
The hierarchical database is a form that arranges data items in a tree-like structure. In this form of database,<br> there are parent and child data segments in the hierarchy. A child can have only one parent but a parent may<br> have more than one child. Invariably, this database gives a one to many relationship.<br>
<br><br>





Network databases<br>
In this form of database, there are multiple interrelationships among records (many-to-many relationship). An<br>  example is shown in the diagrma below<br><br><br>
