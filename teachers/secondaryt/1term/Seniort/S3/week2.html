<p class="justifier">A Computer network is a connection of two or more computers via communication devices in order to share data and<br> resources (printer, software, hard disk etc.). Computers on a network are called nodes or hosts.<br>
Types of computer network<br><br>
Local area network (LAN): This is a kind of network that involves connecting computers and other devices within<br> a limited geographical local such as a building, school, or home. A Wireless LAN (WLAN) is similar to a LAN <br>but uses wireless medium for connection.<br><br>
Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): This network generally expands throughout a city such as cable TV. MAN can help<br> an organization to connect all of its offices in a city.<br><br>
Wide Area Network (WAN): This network covers a wide geographical area such as a country or even the world. Most<br> WANs consist of two or more LANs that are connected by routers. Communication channels can include telephone<br> systems, fiber optics, satellites, microwave etc. The largest WAN is the internet.<br>
Other variations include Personal Area Network (PAN), Campus Area Network (CAN), Home Area Network (HAN) etc.<br>
Network architecture<br>
Peer-to-peer: In this network, the computers connected together are called peers and each handles its security.<br> Peer-to-peer networks are designed to satisfy the networking needs of home networks or of small companies<br> that do not want to spend a lot of money on a dedicated server but still want to have the capability to share<br> information or devices.<br><br>
Client/Server: Computers (clients) are connected to a server. The server takes responsibility of storing <br>clientsâ€™ data and managing other computers (clients) in the network.<br> <br>
Network topology<br>
Topology is the arrangement of nodes (computers) and other devices within a network. Topology can either be:<br>
Physical topology: this is the actual layout of the computers and other connected devices.<br>
Logical topology: this describes the logical pathway signal flow as it passes among the network nodes. It <br>defines the way data passes among the nodes.<br><br>
